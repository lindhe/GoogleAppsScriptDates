# GoogleAppsScriptDates

Some scripts I use in Google Apps Scripts (like in Google Sheets) to handle dates.

## Notice

Google Apps Script is [not quite Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Apps_Script). So just because your code runs in node does not mean it runs in Google Apps.


## Testing

I'll try to keep this to TDD. Let's see where that takes me! I'm using
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), and this obviously requires that you have
installed Node.

I think you run the tests like this:

```
npm test
```

# History

It used to be maintained [here](https://gist.github.com/lindhe/89feb42b0e855218c3526846af7119e7), but it got out-of-hand for a gist so I'll use real revision control instead.
